# My Portfolio

My portfolio web to show a little bit about me.
This portfolio has been made without any frameworks o library. just pure JS, CSS and HTML.

Content:
- Experience
- Downloadable resume (two version English and Spanish)
- Automated Side Projects section (with github API)
- My Links (Linkedin, githibub)
- Dark mode and Light mode
- Mate to share

The side project section is actually automated with the use of github API. Every time I make a new repository it will be automatically displayed in the side project section without the need of update the portfolio site by hand.
